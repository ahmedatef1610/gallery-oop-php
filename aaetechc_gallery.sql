Pompey had been a political ally of Ptolemy XII, but Ptolemy XIII, at the urging of his court eunuchs, had Pompey ambushed and killed before Caesar arrived and occupied <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria\">Alexandria</a>. Caesar then attempted to reconcile the rival Ptolemaic siblings, but Ptolemy\'s chief adviser <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potheinos\">Potheinos</a> viewed Caesar\'s terms as favoring Cleopatra, so <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_army\">his forces</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Alexandria_(47_BC)\">besieged her and Caesar at the palace</a>.
